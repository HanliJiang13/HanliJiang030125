I am Hanli Jiang, a fourth-year Computer Science specialist at the University of Toronto, and a thesis student in the Reimand Lab at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research & UofT. Under the guidance of Professor JÃ¼ri Reimand, I apply machine learning techniques to uncover mutational patterns and chromatin dynamics in cancer evolution. My projects focus on improving the prediction of mutation rates between primary and metastatic tumors, driven by an interest in how genomic features influence cancer progression.

My research interests span computational biology, machine learning, and cancer research, with an emphasis on using machine learning and deep learning models to analyze complex biological data. As I look forward to Fall 2025, I am preparing for a direct-entry PhD in computational biology, aspiring to contribute to advancements in precision medicine and our understanding of cancer genetics.
